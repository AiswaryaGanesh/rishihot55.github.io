            !!!IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ!!!
            Great Job! Looks like you finally decided to read the source code instead of just looking at what the site looks like. 

            If you're finding it hard to read on your browser, please copy the following URL into a new tab and read the code side by side with the web page:
            https://github.com/rishihot55/rishihot55.github.io/blob/master/index.html

            I'm assuming that you've read the basics of HTML5 to directly identify most of these tags.        
            So, let me make a checklist of what tags you're seeing (in order of appearance):
            1. html
            2. head
            3. title
            4. meta
            5. link
            6. script
            7. body
            8. h1
            9. h2
            10. h3
            11. p
            12. section - a semantic tag which specifies that the content in it is a part of a separate section.
            13. div
            14. span

            If you don't understand what some of these tags are, please look them up.

            
            Please read each and every line of code. I've mentioned a lot of information that you might find informative, in case you didn't read about HTML5 thoroughly. 

            Go back to the very first line i.e. the <html> tag and read it completely

            Tags like 'header' and 'section' don't actually have any CSS properties by default. 
            Why do you think they added these new tags in the HTML5 specifications?

        <header class='page-header text-center'>
                <h1>A sample frontend page.</h1>

            Here's an interesting thing about the names of the CSS classes that Bootstrap uses.
            All of them do exactly what they advertise
            
            Take for example,'text-center'. It does what it says i.e. centers the text.

            Q: Why do they not call the css class 'center' instead of 'text-center'?
            .
            .
            .
            .
            .
            .
            .
            Ans: Because things like 'left', 'right' and 'center' do not apply only to text. I can center an image or center some items on a navigation bar. You cannot use the same set of properties for different things.
            It's just like why you cant 'turn' a car the same way as you 'turn' a bike - a car does not have a handlebar.

            Hence an important coding practice is illustrated here - being specific about what you're typing.

                <p>I guess you're just wondering why this site contains very little info. Well, put simply, we don't want you guys to copy a style to use verbatim for the inductions task. We'd want you guys to come up with your own designs and ideas.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class='text-center'>Oh well.</h2>
                <p>It's a bit harsh to just give no hints to you guys. So, let me give you guys a suggestion. Try out the following on your browser:</p>
                <h3 class='text-center'><span class='label label-default'>F12</span></h3> 
                <p class='text-center'>or</p>
                <h3 class='text-center'><span class='label label-default'> Ctrl </span> + <span class='label label-default'> Shift </span> + <span class='label label-default'>C</span></h3>
                <p class='text-center'>or</p>
                <p class='text-center'>Right click on the page and click on <strong>'Developer Tools' / 'View page source'</strong>.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class='text-center'>Full Disclosure</h2>
                <p>I used a CSS library called Bootstrap which saves a lot of time in creating layouts for webpages. I suggest you learn one of the following - <em>Bootstrap</em>, <em>Pure</em>, <em>Materialize</em>, <em>Foundation</em>. But for now, it's not needed. Most of our tasks won't test your knowledge of CSS or Javascript, <em>unless it's explicitly mentioned.</em></p>
